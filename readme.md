# Antiweather

Antiweather compares the weather in one location on Earth to the weather of its antipode, the exact opposite point on Earth.

For every search, the site makes two requests to the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/).

Dark Sky provides current weather and weather forecasts for any coordinate point on Earth, even in the middle of the ocean or the North and South Pole.

Search is provided by [Algolia Places](https://community.algolia.com/places/). Reverse geocoding is accomplished using [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data.

World maps are drawn using [d3](https://d3js.org).

Ads help support the site and are run through [Carbon Ads](https://carbonads.net/).
